Curse of Enchantia DAT utility
---
This utility will create a BMP file out of a decompressed DAT file and its associated PAL (palette) file.

DAT files are compressed with RNC (Rob Northern Compression). An utility to decompress this kind of files can be found [here](https://github.com/lab313ru/rnc_propack_source).

###Installation:
`mvn clean install`

###Usage:
`java -jar coe-read-dat.jar <uncompressed DAT file> <associated PAL file>`

###TODO
- Add --output option
- Add automatic unpacking of RNC-packed files
- Add sprites support
