##Curse of Enchantia image extraction utility
This utility will create a BMP file out of a decompressed DAT file or a SPR file and their associated PAL (palette) file.

DAT files are compressed with RNC (Rob Northern Compression). An utility to decompress this kind of files can be found [here](https://github.com/lab313ru/rnc_propack_source).

The utility is also able to print a PAL file's colors into the terminal.

###Installation:
`mvn clean install`

###Usage:
`java -jar coe-read-dat.jar [dat|spr|pal] <uncompressed DAT file|SPR file> <associated PAL file>`

###TODO
- Complete sprites support
- Add automatic unpacking of RNC-packed files
